        <p class="project-body">Come on! Have a jelly baby. Every great decision creates ripples. Like a huge boulder dropping in a lake. The ripples merge and rebound off the banks in unforseeable ways. The heavier the decision, the larger the waves, the more uncertain the consequences. One day, just one day, maybe I'll meet somebody who gets the whole 'don't wander off' thing. There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought.</p>

        <p class="project-body">But it was a childish dream that made you a doctor. You dreamed you could hold back death. Isn't that true? I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot! The world's about to end, and here I am, stuck in traffic. He was dead already, I'm saving us. Follow me, and run! I reversed the polarity of the neutron flow. Go and be the Doctor that I could never be. There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought.</p>

        <p class="project-body">Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments, not water pistols. I've lived for over 2000 years and not all of them have been good. Ricky, if I was to tell you what I was doing to the controls of my frankly magnificent timeship, would you even begin to understand? Eight minutes is ages. What if I get bored? Give me knitting. You know how it is; you put things off for a day and next thing you know, it's a hundred years later. A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting.</p>
